##What It Is
---
This is a collaborative project where we made a game utilizing the front-end knowledge gained so far. We made an interactive game where the user has to prevent the growing zombie horde from getting to the center of the city by whatever means necessary. As time goes on, the game increases in diffulty with respectively increased perks for getting that far. Survive as long as you can!

##What We Used
---
The following languages and APIs were used:
  * HTML
  * CSS / SASS
  * JavaScript
  * jQuery
  * Leaflet
  * Math (lots and lots of math)

##Challenges and Solutions
---
This project was not without its stumbling blocks from the beginning. We solved most problems in a timely manner, but at times we had to pivot entirely in order to work within the restrictions of the API.

  * Challenge #1: Switching APIs
  
	 At the beginning of our project, we were originally going to use the Mapbox API to build our game, but upon closer inspection we realized Mapbox was actually a plugin for the Leaflet API, which had much broader functionality and a variety of features and plugins that would better suit our needs. This was early in the project though, so we were able to convert our current code base into Leaflet and be at the same place. Pivot 1.

  * Challenge #2: Rogue scripts in the bottom of our code

  	We moved along for a while figuring out how to generate random markers on the map, which worked well. Then we hit another snag - for some reason we couldn't add event listeners to our markers (zombies), and no one could figure out why. For a few hours we were paralyzed combing through the code, and examples online trying to find a solution or workaround. By finally isolating each bit of code in our index.html page, we found a rogue Mapbox script that was messing everything up. Once it was commented out the click listener worked. And we could click zombies and they'd disappear. Bingo.

  * Challenge #3: Implementing different zombie weapons and game functions 

    Zombies could now be eliminated by clicking directly on them on the map, but that wasn't good enough. We wanted special tools that could kill multiple zombies at once. We came up with a radius blast that wiped them out (by identifying the markers inside its radius and removing them as well as taking them off of an array list), we also had a chainsaw function that would turn the user's mouse into a chainsaw icon and they could then hover over zombies for a set amount of time and mow them down. 

    The problem was how to allow the user to select from these different weapons (and also start a new game, see their kill score, etc.). The answer came in the form of a floating menu bar. The buttons on the bar allowed users to select the bomb option (which was set to a timer so it was only available after a certain amount of time passed) or the chainsaw option (with the same sort of timer system), it also had a start button and a kill score counter featuring just how many zombies had already been eliminated.

  * Challenge #4: Making the zombies move

    A zombie outbreak game is a great idea, but it's not nearly as much fun if the zombies don't converge and kill any remaining survivors. We were bound and determined to get the zombies randomly generating on our map to move, and so we set the centerpoint of the map as the location we wanted them all to move towards. That way, players would have to defend the castle there, or be overrun and the game would be over. 

    This decision to make them mobile proved harder than we anticipated. The first approach we tried to get the zombies to move involved higher level math the likes of which hadn't been seen since our days of AP Calculus in high school. The first step involved making sure the zombies spawned outside of a certain radius of the center of the map (to give the player a fighting chance). So a circular radius from the centerpoint was determined and if the random point for a zombie was defined inside of that radius the calculation picking a point would run again until it was outside the circle. Ok. So far, so good.

    Then we needed the zombies to move back towards the center regardless of where they'd been dropped around it. Our first few tries involved segmenting the map into four quadrants, determining the distance from the center by a zombie's latitudinal and longitudinal coordinants and then updating their coordinates at a set interval to inch them closer to the goal. We got the zombies moving, but getting them to move in the correct direction wasn't working. After many hours spent writing math heavy code invoking sine, cosine, etas, thetas and triangular hypotenuses (and still not getting the desired result), we checked out Leaflet's extensive list of plugins. And lo and behold, the Leaflet.MovingMarker plugin turned out to be our saving grace. With a new file, a few more lines of code and a set centerpoint all the zombies could move towards regardless of their starting position. It was a game changer because we were willing to abandon the hours of work we'd already put in in favor of a premade solution adapted to us.

  * Challenge #5: Having the building explode when it was overrun

    We wanted a very visual way to show the game had ended, and since the city center was being overrun, what better way than with an explosion of the city hall? However, because of where we were working there was no easy way to have a GIF or other animation happen. But that wouldn't stop us. 

    We got creative and made a function where all the individual images of each element of the explosion animation were taken, and then set them all to separate timeout functions each one tenth of a second after the other one before them. And voila! City hall implodes in a fiery explosion.

##MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
---
The MVP for this project was achieved relatively quickly once we got a general idea of the power and scope of the Leaflet API, which is quite extensive. 

Our first MVP iteration included:
  * The zombies randomly generating inside our predefined map bounds.
  * Being able to click the zombies and remove them from the map (i.e. kill them).
  * End the game when the zombies overtook the map beyond the point of redemption.

Since we got a working code base of these features done with days to go, we moved on to our stretch goals detailed below.  

##Our Stretch Goals
---
We got to work on our stretch goals almost before the MVP was done, and they've evolved over time as we hit roadblocks along the way and got better acquainted with the intricacies of Leaflet.

Our second game iteration, which we dubbed the IVP (Intermediate Viable Product), included the following features:
  * A menu item to keep track of game features like upgraded weapon options (airstrikes, landmines and chainsaws, etc.), a score counter to count the zombies eliminated and a start / restart button for the game.
  * Better CSS styling of the game.
  * Randomly dropping the starting zombies outside a certain radius of the middle point of the city and then having them slowly move towards the center where the homebase would be set up.

Because we were ambitious, we even defined a third set of goals we dubbed the AVP (Advanced Viable Product). This was where our dreams for this game's scope got really lofty:
  * Make the zombie outbreak national in scope instead of limiting it to the city of Atlanta.
  * Create different levels of weapons doing different levels of damage to the zombie hordes as the map gets more and more crowded with them.
  * Build a storyline giving players some background in to what's happening and how to fight the outbreak. Set up multiple landmarks on the map as places to defend.
  * Add in a cheesy zombie video.

It's safe to say the plans for this game got bigger and grander as the week progressed.

##Code Examples 
--- 
jQuery and JavaScript controlling the menu bar 
```javascript
  $('#start').on('click', function(){ 
      // generation = setInterval(generateMarkers, 500); 
      interval = setInterval(generateMarkers, spawnInterval);
      playOptions(); 
      bombDelay();
      mineDelay();
      chainsawDelay();
      centerChecker = setInterval(checkCenter, 1000);
      mineListen = setInterval(amIPlaced, 1000);
      $('#start').toggleClass('bomb-available');
  }) 
 ``` 

JavaScript to check if zombies are close to city center 
```javascript 
  function checkCenter() { 
    dangerZombies = []; 
    // console.log(dangerZombies); 
    var widthValue = 50; 
    if(dangerZombies.length < 10){ 
      for(i = 0; i < markerList.length; i++) { 
        if (getDistanceFromLatLonInKm(markerList[i]._latlng.lat, markerList[i]._latlng.lng, point[0], point[1]) < 12){ 
          dangerZombies.push(markerList[i]); 
          howManyZombiesInside.innerHTML = dangerZombies.length; 
        } 
      } 
    } 
    if(dangerZombies.length > 0 && dangerZombies.length < 10){ 
      widthValue = widthValue * dangerZombies.length; 
      widthValue += 'px'; 
      $('.danger-wrapper').css({'width':widthValue}) 
    } 
    if(dangerZombies.length > 5 && dangerZombies.length < 10){ 
      $('.danger-wrapper').toggleClass('bomb-available'); 
    } 
    if(dangerZombies.length >= 10){ 
      howManyZombiesInside.innerHTML = "Game over man! Game over!"; 
      function stop(){ 
        clearInterval(interval); 
        clearInterval(centerChecker); 
      }; 
      stop(); 
      widthValue = '300px'; 
      $('.danger-wrapper').css({'width':widthValue}); 
    } 
  } 
``` 
 
JavaScript to change the cursor to a chainsaw and hover over zombies to kill them 
```javascript 
  function sawed(marker){ 
    if(chainsawSelected){ 
      marker.setIcon(corpseIcon); 
      setTimeout(function(){ 
        map.removeLayer(marker); 
      }, 1000) 
       
      scoreboard.innerHTML++; 
        var index = markerList.indexOf(marker); 
              if(index > -1){ 
                  markerList.splice(index, 1); 
              } 
      setTimeout(function(){ 
        chainsawAvailable = false; 
        chainsawSelected = false; 
        $('body, .leaflet-interactive').removeClass('chainsaw-cursor'); 
        chainsawDelay(); 
      }, 5000) 
    } 
  } 
``` 

Sample of JavaScript to make the explosion animation
```javascript 
function explosion(){
  setTimeout(function(){
    castle = L.icon({iconUrl: 'img2/explosion_1.png', iconSize: [96, 96]});
    home.setIcon(castle)
    home.setZIndexOffset(1000);
  }, 100);
  setTimeout(function(){
    castle = L.icon({iconUrl: 'img2/explosion_2.png', iconSize: [96, 96]});
    home.setIcon(castle)
  }, 200);
  setTimeout(function(){
    castle = L.icon({iconUrl: 'img2/explosion_3.png', iconSize: [96, 96]});
    home.setIcon(castle)
  }, 300);
  setTimeout(function(){
    castle = L.icon({iconUrl: 'img2/explosion_4.png', iconSize: [96, 96]});
    home.setIcon(castle)
  }, 400);
  setTimeout(function(){
    castle = L.icon({iconUrl: 'img2/explosion_5.png', iconSize: [96, 96]});
    home.setIcon(castle)
  }, 500);
}
```
